<h1>Policies</h1> 
<h2>Financing</h2>
<p> In terms of financing, we started the business by finding loans that would cover the cost of the start-up process. Those have since been paid off, and the business is running self sufficiently at this point. We sell the product in a first in last out procedure to ensure that perishables like the dog food get sold before they expire.</p>

<h2>Delivery</h2>
<p>We do not have an online store, however when products are not in stock and need to be customer ordered for a customer, we send them directly to the customers house using FedEx. </p>

<h2>Return Policies</h2>
<p> Returns can be made within 30 days with proof of purchase and original tags attached.   </p>
